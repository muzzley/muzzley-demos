# Muzzley Demos

In these JavaScript demos we try to show you some examples of what's possible with `muzzley`. All these demos can be tested at [http://muzzley.com](http://muzzley.com), more specifically at the widgets documentation pages: [http://www.muzzley.com/documentation/widgets.html](http://www.muzzley.com/documentation/widgets.html) and components documentation pages: [http://www.muzzley.com/documentation/components.html](http://www.muzzley.com/documentation/components.html) .

To interact with the demos, first you have to download the muzzley application to your smartphone. At [http://www.muzzley.com](http://www.muzzley.com) you have the links to the supported platforms (iOS and Android). Then download these demos to your computer, choose a demo and open the specific HTML file in your browser. This file represents a browser application that is _muzzley-enabled_.

A few moments after opening a demo, a QR code image should appear. This means that the demo connected to the muzzley servers and an _activity_ has been successfully created. The activity represents an instance of the _muzzley-enabled_ application, represented by a unique activity id or muzzley QR code.

Take a look at the text box at the bottom of the demos, it has a log and will help you follow what's happening in the code.

If you hover your mouse over the log text area of a demo, you can see the JSON action messages formatted. This feature is only available for action messages, which are messages sent by the participant each time you perform an action in a widget.

Scan the QR code with your muzzley application to pair your phone with the browser app. When the phone is successfully paired with the app, it becomes a participant of the activity.

From this point onwards, what each demo shows depends on the widget it's demonstrating.
